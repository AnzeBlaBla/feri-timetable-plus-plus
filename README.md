# Feri Timetable Plus Plus

A timetable application for FERI UM. Goal is group selection per subject (as that's not supported on the official site, for some reason...)
> [!WARNING] VIBE CODING AHEAD
> This project is not a reflection of my coding ability. It is a vibecoded app that was created purely for myself and is not meant to be trusted, used by other people, or even touched or upgraded, ever, in the future.
> If you are a masochist and would like to look into the code, I recommend a premium subscription to your LLM of choice, because any code in here has not been seen by a human, and should never be.
